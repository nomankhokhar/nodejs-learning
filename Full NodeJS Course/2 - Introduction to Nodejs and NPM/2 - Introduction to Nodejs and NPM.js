// NodeJS is JS Runtime Built On Google Chrome's V8 JS Engine

// We can use NodeJS to run JS on the server

// When to use NodeJS
    // -> Single Threaded based on event driven non-blocking I/O model
    // -> Perfect for building fast and scalable data-intensive apps
    // -> Real-time chat apps, live streaming apps, etc.
    // -> Server Side web applications

// NodeJS is not good for CPU intensive apps
    // -> Image manipulation, video encoding, etc.
    // -> Because it's single threaded
    // -> Applications that require heavy computation should be built using other languages like Python, Java, etc.


// Companies like NETFLIX, UBER, PAYPAL, etc. use NodeJS
// Another reason to use NodeJS is that it's built on JS, so you can use the same language on the client and server side
// NodeJS is open source and has a large community
// Huge library of modules available through NPM (Node Package Manager)





// For installing the dev and project dependency

// npm i {packageName}
// npm i {packageName} --save-dev
// npm outdated
// npm update {packageName}
